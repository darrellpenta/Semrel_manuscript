PROP: ASSOCIATION NORMING A 3 (relatedness) $\times$ 2 (local noun number) ANOVA on the data revealed a main effect of relatedness (\textit{F}(2,46)=17.182, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.04375, \textit{p}\textless.001) and a marginally significant interaction between relatedness and local noun number (\textit{F}(2,46)=2.4935, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.0328, \textit{p}\textless.10).Proportions were significantly greater for attribute associates than for pure associates, evidenced by a main effect of relatedness when the subset ofattribute associates and pure associates were analyzed (\textit{F}(1,23)=4.746, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.05709, \textit{p}\textless.05);Comparing the subset of attribute associates with unrelated items also revealed a main effect of relatedness, with attribute associates generating higher association proportions than the unrelated items, (\textit{F}(1,23)=28.78, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.05186, \textit{p},\textless.001) as well as a marginally significant interaction between relatedness and local noun number  (\textit{F}(1,23)=4.147, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.028529, \textit{p}\textless.10).The interaction in this case is due to the fact that association proportions for singular attribute associates were significantly larger than for singular unrelated items  (\textit{F}(1,23)=25.863, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.04739, \textit{p}\textless.001, and proportions for plural attribute associates were also larger than for the unrelated items (\textit{F}(1,23)=11.673, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.033, \textit{p}\textless.01.A comparison of pure assocciates and unrelated items also revealed a main effect of relatedness, with pure associates generating higher proportions than the unrelated items, (\textit{F}(1,23)=22.051, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.022295, \textit{p}, as well as a significant interaction between relatedness and local noun number  (\textit{F}(1,23)=5.178, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.024502, \textit{p}\textless.05).In this case, the interaction iwas being driven by a significant different in proportions for the singular  associates relative to the singular unrelated items  (\textit{F}(1,23)=22.862, \textit{MS$_e$}=0.024452, \textit{p}\textless.001.
